Integrate the highest layer of security into Stream Chat React to protect users' messages, media, and conversation history.

## Run the project
You should create a new React app with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and copy the project files into yours or create a new GitHub Code Space to run the app. The `.env` file in the GitHub project requires your Seald credentials. 

**Note**: Running the final project requires Stream and Seald SDKs credentials. Signup for [Stream](https://getstream.io/try-for-free/) and [Seald](https://dashboard.staging-0.seald.io/) accounts and follow the first article below to get started. The second article introduces you to fundamental concepts of E2EE.
